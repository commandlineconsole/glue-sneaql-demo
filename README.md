This repository has all the sample artifacts needed for AWS Glue and SneaQL demonstration. 

AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (extract, transform, and load) service that makes it simple and cost-effective to categorize your data, clean it, enrich it and move it reliably between various data stores. 
The AWS Glue Data Catalog provides a central metadata repository that is Hive Metastore compatible. SneaQL developed by Full360 provides variables, loops, and conditions to static ANSI SQL. simply Store SQL in Git repo then use SneaQL on ECS to execute SQL against your database.

SneaQL is Free/open source software and runs in a freely available Docker container

The two complement each other well, you can use AWS Glue to transform your data and load it to your data warehouse and use SneaQL to continue transforming the data using custom SQL.

This demo shows upsert for partitioned data in JSON after converting to Parquet and then loading in Redshift.

You should go to the Full360/SneaQL [wiki](https://github.com/full360/sneaql/wiki)  for instructions on installation and usage.
